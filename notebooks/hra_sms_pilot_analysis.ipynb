Using real-world data patterns, members were grouped by health needs, age, and past engagement. The system then ranked them to decide who should be contacted first. The visuals help care teams and strategy leads quickly identify where to focus their outreach.\n",

This can lead to increased CMS bonus payments and enhanced plan reputation. Future updates may include sample text messages or tools that automate how messages are sent and tracked."
